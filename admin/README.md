# Notes on the Admin Page

Keep the LICENSE with the **ColorlibHQ** name for compliance.

The framework is based off of a popular bootstrap theme called [AdminLTE](https://github.com/ColorlibHQ/AdminLTE). It has been greatly reduced for the purposes of this project.

All custom (non-template) files are found:

```

        pages\ - All javascript is here, seperated by page
