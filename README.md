# Technology

We will be using a SCRUM style development approach. Currently it is seperated into 3 different sprints.  
The technologies we will be woking with are HTML/CSS (Frameworks), JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, Heroku, and Docker.  
This is an ongoing project that we will be taking over from previous students in Capstone II. We will be continuing to update the website according to Dr. Vorachek's guidance and wishes.

# Impacts

We have chosen these technologies since they are becoming the industry standard and have the highest growth rate compared to other technologies used in similar applications.  
These technologies have also been used so far in the projects development and are some of the most maintainable technologies we can use.

# Project Management

We will follow the Scrum approach, thus your team needs to identify the task in each sprint cycles, team meeting schedules, including this Fall and next Spring semester. The tenative schedule and sprint cycles for Spring 2022 are as follows.
Ww will be following a SCRUM style approach to managment.
